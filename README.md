## About this project

**About the project:**

As a Business Analyst, I led the initiative to convert data into in-depth insights, focusing on the sales performance of a global restaurant chain. This Restaurant Order Analysis project aimed to derive meaningful insights from menu and order data through SQL queries. By tackling critical business objectives—such as refining menu selections, streamlining inventory processes, and boosting customer experience—this analysis offers strategic recommendations to support business growth.
